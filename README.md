# 🐇 Down the Rabbit Hole

*Copy a line of Japanese, fall in, and read your way through.* A visual-novel
**texthooker** with a **built-in offline Japanese→English dictionary**.
It watches your Windows clipboard for Japanese text (e.g. extracted from a game by
[Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor)), shows it in a clean reader,
and gives you a **hover dictionary** — point at any word to see its meaning, reading,
and part of speech, Yomitan-style.



---

## Quick start

```sh
# (recommended) better word-frequency ranking during the build
python -m pip install wordfreq

# 1. One-time setup — downloads the kuromoji tokenizer, JMdict, and the
#    JMnedict name dictionary, then builds the database.
python setup.py            # (or double-click setup.bat)
#    python setup.py --no-names   # skip names to keep the DB small (~74 MB vs ~250 MB)

# 2. Run it
python server.py           # (or double-click run.bat)
```

Your browser opens at `http://127.0.0.1:3939`. Copy some Japanese text and it
appears instantly. Hover a word for its definition.

### Using it with a game

1. Run a text extractor such as **Textractor** and hook your visual novel.
2. In Textractor, enable the **Copy to Clipboard** extension (it ships with it).
3. Start this app — every line the game produces shows up automatically.

**Tip:** click a word to pin its popup open; press **Esc** to close. Hover gives a quick peek.

### Visual-novel frequency ranking (optional, recommended for VN readers)

By default, ranking uses a general-corpus frequency (`wordfreq`). For VN-accurate
ranking, import a **visual-novel frequency list** from
[jiten.moe](https://jiten.moe/other):

1. Go to **https://jiten.moe/other**, pick **Visual Novel**, and download the
   **Yomitan** frequency dictionary (a `.zip`). Save it into this folder.
2. Rebuild with it:
   ```sh
   python setup.py --skip-kuromoji --force --freq jiten_vn.zip
   ```

Now lookups prefer the reading that's common in visual novels, and a longer match is
only chosen over a shorter common word when it's itself a common VN word — so 一日中
and という still win, but a rare homograph like 底荷「そこに」"ballast" never buries
そこ "there". Frequency data: jiten.moe, **CC BY-SA 4.0**. (Definitions remain
JMdict/JMnedict — the same sources jiten itself uses.)

**No-manual-step alternative:** `python setup.py --skip-kuromoji --force --innocent`
auto-downloads the **Innocent Corpus** VN/novel frequency list instead. It's convenient
but coarser — it omits some very common function words and under-counts する — so the
hand-downloaded jiten.moe VN list above is recommended. The frequency loader
auto-detects rank-style vs. count-style lists, so any Yomitan frequency `.zip` works
with `--freq`.

## Features

- **Auto clipboard capture** over Server-Sent Events — text appears the moment it's copied.
- **Offline dictionary** built from JMdict (the standard free J–E dictionary). Works with no internet after setup.
- **Smart longest-match scanning** — catches multi-word expressions and compounds the
  tokenizer splits (一日中, という), with a full de-inflector that also shows the
  inflection trail (読んでいた → 読む · progressive › past).
- **Tokenizer-anchored ranking** so the intended word comes first. It trusts kuromoji's
  own analysis of each token — part-of-speech (は = particle, not 羽 "feather"), reading
  (本【ほん】"book", not 本【もと】"origin"), dictionary form (居る "to be", not 射る
  "to shoot") — and only lets a *longer* match win when that longer match is itself a
  common word. So そこ stays "there" (not the rare 底荷 "ballast"), 村 stays "village"
  (not a surname), while real compounds like 一日中 and という are still caught.
- **Name dictionary (JMnedict)** — recognizes character and place names (田中 → "Tanaka"),
  ranked below a real word of the same length.
- **Polished popup** — click a word to pin it open, a copy button, and a Jisho.org link;
  hover for a quick peek.
- **Furigana toggle**, **text alignment** (left / center / right / justify), adjustable
  font size with **bold/italic** toggles, **themes** (six Wonderland palettes plus
  custom colours & fonts), pause/resume capture, undo, and clear.
- A flat, editorial reading UI — every colour (including the toolbar fill) is derived
  from the active theme, so the whole interface re-themes consistently.
- Everything runs locally on `127.0.0.1`; nothing is sent anywhere, and no account or payment is needed.

## Toolbar

| Control | What it does |
|---|---|
| status dot | Connection state at a glance — green = ready, orange = paused, red = disconnected (hover for the label) |
| **Pause** / **Resume** | Stop/continue reading the clipboard |
| **Furigana** | Show readings above kanji |
| ▤ alignment icons | Text alignment — left, center, right, or justify |
| **Theme** | Opens the Appearance panel (themes, colours, font, bold/italic) |
| A slider | Reader font size |
| **Undo** | Remove the most recent line |
| **Clear** | Clear all lines (click twice to confirm) |

### Appearance panel

Click **Theme** to open it:

- **Theme** — six Wonderland palettes (Alice, Caterpillar, Cheshire, Mad Hatter, Queen
  of Hearts, White Rabbit). Picking one recolours everything — toolbar, popup, reader,
  highlights — since every surface derives its colour from the same six theme variables.
- **Colours** — override any individual swatch (background, text, accent, reading,
  tag, furigana) on top of the current theme.
- **Font** — pick a font stack (sans, Gothic, Mincho serif, rounded, or monospace); use
  the toolbar's **A** slider for size.
- **B** / *I* — toggle bold or italic for the reader text.
- **Reset to default** — clears every override back to the default theme.

All of the above is saved to your browser's local storage and restored automatically
next time you open the page — no flash of the wrong theme on load.

## Setup options

```sh
python setup.py --common     # smaller "common words only" dictionary
python setup.py --force      # redownload + rebuild everything
python setup.py --skip-kuromoji   # only rebuild the dictionary DB
```

## Server options

```sh
python server.py --port 7000     # use a different port
python server.py --no-browser    # don't auto-open the browser
```

## How it works

```
 game ──Textractor──> Windows clipboard
                           │  (ctypes polling)
                      server.py ──SSE──> browser
                           │                 │ kuromoji tokenize
                       dict.sqlite <─lookup──┘ hover popup
```

- `setup.py` downloads kuromoji.js + its dictionary into `static/kuromoji/`, and
  builds `dict.sqlite` (entries + a term index) from JMdict.
- `server.py` polls the clipboard, streams new text to the page, and serves
  longest-match lookups from the SQLite dictionary via `/scan` (de-inflecting and
  ranking candidates so the intended word comes first).
- `static/app.js` tokenizes each line in the browser, wraps words in hoverable
  spans, and fetches definitions on demand.

## Notes

- Clipboard monitoring is Windows-only (uses the Win32 clipboard API). The UI and
  dictionary still work on other platforms — paste text manually.
- The dictionary database and downloaded tokenizer are not committed; run
  `setup.py` to generate them.
